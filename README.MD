## Branches 

- Master branch will have the offical release version, currently 2.0a

- Branches will be for implementing new math code, or new ux features 

- Will eventually have a Branch for Devices platforms, Android, Apple, 

- Another Branch for Bootstrap or React UX version 

## version 2.0a

  - Milestone :

    - The app demonstrates the basics of most calculators 

      - Basic Math: positive and negative numbers, add, substract, divide, multiply
      
      - For example, most use the %, as percent. So divide value by 100.

      - AC, C and Decimals and equals, =, buttons.

      - As on a handle-held calcaulator, at first, a blinking zero indicates the calcutor is ready for input

    - I got the app working, to a reasonable degree

      -  Future versions will have scientific and accounting modes
  
    - I am working out a few bugs, by sticking with basics used by others

        - most calculators only do math to 14 decimal places 

        - don't display trailing zeros

        - decimals displayed and operated on when entered


## version 2.1a

  - Goal :

    - implement new app data model

    - simplify and create better app logic

    - finish all-clear/clear functionality

    - setup basis for additional features

## version 3.0a

  - Goal : implement at least 2 "coming features"

## Coming Features

  - complete All Clear and Clear (currently has bugs)

    - AC and C functions, to work as standard calculator    

    - a "novel" backspace key
      - when entering numbers, AC becomes backspace key
      - as all of current entry backspaced
      - then backspace turns into C,
      - becomes into AC when no current values to clear,

  - logging feature
    - internal storage of app status and values
    - error codes generated by browser, stored also
    - "send to support" feature

  - Memory functions

  - show math feature
    - when enabled, if entering "3" "+" "3" "="
    - middle display line to show:                3 + 3
    - when pressing =, bottom line to show :          6
      - on 2nd calc, another number with 3rd operator
        - top display line to show                   3 + 3
        - middle display line to show:               6 * 3
        - when pressing =, bottom line to show :        18

  - a show tape feature, a history of math operations
    - a complete separate window,
    - history of math and results
    - uses available browser functionality
      - like "send to" or "share", to print, msg or email

  - more modes with advanced calculator layout

  - MIT License

## Current Version 2.0a

### Milestone

  - all basic mode features, unit tested successfully
  - basic math operations give correct answers

  - javascript custom debug feature
    - manually enable in browser javascript console
    - wrapped console.log, but preserving line number
    ```
    console.log.bind(window.console)  
    ```

### TODO

  - fix things that work intermittently
    - clear
    - multiple math ops

  - better data model and app logic

  - debugger
    - error logging and error handling

  - tape
    - history of input and math results

  - for release
    - improve logic for tracking input, calculations
    - port to react or bootstrap

  - UI features
    - a menu
      - a "show tape" button in the menu
      - actually displaying the tape
    - a backspace key,
      - preferably within current UI

  - backend ops
    - new build environment
    - considering a CMS
