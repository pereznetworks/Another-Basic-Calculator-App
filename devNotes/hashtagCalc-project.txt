/* #Calc, Alpha v.1.0a */


/* goals for Alpha v.2.0, for March 2018

   bug: when using calc.posNeg method
      indication : if user clicks posNeg button, right after,
                      then secondNumberValue is assigned the parseInt of numberValue
                        which is the original value before conversion
                          displayed value then remains the same
                            without displayed input value being re-processed
      diagnosis : issue is input stream not being re-read unless another number is actually entered
      solution  : rather than fix current code
                    implementing input stream object array will fix this bug also
                      then last value in input object array will be sum of whatever previous math op
                        then can be used for successive math ops

   to do:

   UI upgrade: use icons for number and operation buttons
      UI upgrade: convert layout for mobile devices
      UI enhancement: AC/C toggle
      UI enhancement: scientific calculator layout
      UI enhancement: calculator printable tape

   core upgrade: implement an input stream object array
      merge #Calc object-method code with AVC and danielsMath.js Library
      debug, logging and error handling

   done:
   UI enhancement: new UI layout
   UI enhancement: buttons actions animation
   UI enhancement:layout design tweeks
   core JavaScript code from AVC and #Calc combined
   added 1 default and 2 other possible input display fields,
